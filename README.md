# News Article Summarization using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project focuses on building an automated system that can summarize lengthy news articles into concise and meaningful summaries using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.  
The goal is to help readers quickly grasp the key points of news articles without reading the full text.

## Problem Statement
With the growing volume of digital news, manually reading and understanding full-length articles is time-consuming. An ML-based summarization model provides a solution by generating short, relevant, and human-like summaries automatically.

## Dataset
- News articles collected from publicly available sources (e.g., Kaggle, online news datasets).  
- Each article contains a title, full text, and reference summary (if available).  
- Preprocessing steps include tokenization, stopword removal, stemming/lemmatization, and text cleaning.

## Methodology
1. *Data Preprocessing* – Clean and prepare text data for analysis.  
2. *Feature Extraction* – Use TF-IDF, Bag of Words, or word embeddings.  
3. *Model Selection*  
   - Extractive Summarization (e.g., TextRank, LSA).  
   - Abstractive Summarization using deep learning models (e.g., Seq2Seq, Transformers like BERT/T5).  
4. *Model Training & Evaluation* – Train models on article-summary pairs and evaluate using metrics such as ROUGE, BLEU, and accuracy.  
5. *Prediction* – Generate summaries for new/unseen articles.  

## Tools & Libraries
- *Python*  
- *NLTK / SpaCy* – Text preprocessing  
- *Scikit-learn* – ML algorithms and feature extraction  
- *TensorFlow / PyTorch* – Deep learning models  
- *Transformers (HuggingFace)* – Pre-trained summarization models (BERT, T5, GPT)  
- *Matplotlib / Seaborn* – Visualization  

## Workflow
1. Load dataset  
2. Preprocess text data  
3. Extract features  
4. Train ML/DL models  
5. Generate summaries  
6. Evaluate and visualize results  

## Advantages
- Saves time by reducing article length.  
- Provides concise, human-like summaries.  
- Useful for journalists, researchers, and readers who need quick insights.  

## Challenges
- Maintaining grammatical correctness in abstractive summaries.  
- Handling ambiguous or biased text.  
- Requires large datasets and computational resources.  

## Future Scope
- Deploy as a *web or mobile app* for real-time summarization.  
- Multilingual summarization support.  
- Personalized summaries based on user preferences.  

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how Machine Learning and NLP can be applied to automatically summarize news articles. It provides a foundation for advanced applications in text summarization and natural language understanding.
